    <p>What is CSS?
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>
        <H2 style="background-color: rgb(98, 151, 45);"> explaining the different ways CSS can be inserted into a web page</H2>
        <P>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

            With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
            
            Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
            
            Using CSS
            CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
            
            Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
            Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
            External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file</P>
            <h3>different CSS selectors</h3>
            <p>class Selector, and element, I.D selector</p>
            <p>The class selector is a way to select all of the elements with the specified class name, and apply styles to each of the matching elements</p>
            <p>The element selector is a way to select all the elements with a given tag name in a document, and apply the same styles to each element with the tag name</p>
             <p>he id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element</p>
